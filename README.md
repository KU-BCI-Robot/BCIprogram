# Robotic Arm Control based on Motor Imagery EEG
A user-friendly application for experiencing and simulating a BCI system for robotic arm control, with or without a physical robot / EEG device. 
Features an intuitive GUI for mode selection (_Real_ / _Virtual_ mode), system calibration using user's own EEG, step-by-step tutorial for using the app, and many more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **_Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)_**: Needed for EEG data streaming. Users intending to use the application with an EEG device must have LSL installed and properly configured for their specific hardware. Alternatively, users can try the application without an EEG device, which runs a dummy simulation without actual user input.
- **_MATLAB 2022b Runtime_**: Required for running the application. Users will be automatically guided through the steps to install it when they first launch the app. 

### Installation

Running the app is straightforward:

1. Download the executable file (RoboticArmControl.exe) from this repository.
2. Double-click the executable to start the automatic installation process.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and use the application, please refer to the [User Manual](https://github.com/KU-BCI-Robot/BCIprogram/blob/main/UserManual_RoboticArmControl.pdf)
